## What is React/ReactJS/React.js?
- A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. (A client-side JavaScript library).
- All about building modern, reactive user interfaces for the web.
- JavaScript runs in the browser - on the loaded pages. We can manipulate the HTML structure (DOM) of the page.
- Declarative, component (Class based or Function based) focused approach.
- React.js - Lean and focused component based UI library. Certain features (e.g., routing) are added via community packages.

## SPAs (Single Page Applications)
- React can be used to control parts of HTML or entire pages.
- React can be used to control entire frontend of a web application.
- In SPA (Single Page Application) approach, server only sends one HTML page, thereafter, React takes over and controls the UI.

## ReactJS Alternatives
- Angular - Complete component-based UI framework, packed with features. Uses TypeScript. Can be overkill for smaller projects.
- Vue.js - Complete component-based UI framrwork, includes more core features. A bit less popular than React & Angular.
